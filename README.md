# vscode, java, maven, unittest, WSL2 - boiler plate

## Why

Vscode is a stubborn donkey, sometimes - in case you have a WSL2 Setup. 

### Setup

1. WSL2 Debian
1. Vscode
1. Java
1. Maven builder
1. Unit Tests in between vscode using plugin 'test runner for java'
1. I am too lazy to find general solution right now

### Issues to be answered: 
Path finding problems on compiling, run, debugging. Finding unit tests in plugin. Running and debugging unit tests in plugin. 

## Usage

1. clone and delete .git folder/ go ahead using own repo 
1. always open vscode by path on /mnt/c/Users/JohnDoe/MyProjectFolder

## Future Task

1. Find solution to be able to open code by home symlink
1. Push functional tests
